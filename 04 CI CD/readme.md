1: Create a repository using GitLab (git.epam.com). Add npm scripts (can be lint with eslint or test with several dummy tests using any test tools)

2: Give Access rights to your mentor. Add index.html with some static data and a simple script file which will show your name on the page. Create a merge request with your changes and add your mentor as a reviewer

3: Setup Continuous integration configuration (GitLab) which will run your scripts after merge to the repository.

4: Add integration with analysis service Plato (https://github.com/es-analysis/plato)

5: Setup hosting static home works page using AWS S3
